# PFF_PeD
PointCloud Fast Filter for People Detection

The algorithm "PointCloud Fast Filter for People Detection" (PFF-PeD) detects people by processing effectively point-cloud data, independently of the specific 3D sensor employed. By focusing on the most informative observations, PFF-PeD is able to improve the accuracy and processing times compared to existing 2D and 3D solutions. We implemented PFF-PeD in C++ and integrated its operation in ROS Kinetic Kame in a laptop with Ubuntu 16.04.

## How to build with catkin
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/cafemesa/PFF_PeD.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

## How to run

### Launch Files (roslaunch)

#### Requirements

To run the detection with the Astra Camera (from: https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera):

```sh
$ sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rgbd-launch ros-$ROS_DISTRO-libuvc ros-$ROS_DISTRO-libuvc-camera ros-$ROS_DISTRO-libuvc-ros
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera
$ ./ros_astra_camera/scripts/create_udev_rules
$ https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_launch.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

To run the detection with the Velodyne:

```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
$ catkin_make
```
